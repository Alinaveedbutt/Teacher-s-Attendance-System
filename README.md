Teacher-Attendance-Management-System
This is a console based C++ project that manages teacher attendance, calculates late arrivals, early leaves, short hours, and excess work hours. It supports functionalities like adding, searching, deleting teachers, and saving/loading data to/from a file. Admin users (Head/Manager/Supervisor) can log in and generate various attendance reports â€” daily, monthly, or within a custom date range. The system uses OOP principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation, making it ideal for academic or learning purposes.
